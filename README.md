# Markdown Magic: The Story Behind Retail Sales

## Overview

Picture this: it’s just before a big holiday, and your favorite store is buzzing with discounts. Those markdowns? They’re not random—there’s a strategy behind them aimed at boosting sales during key times. But what if we could predict how effective these markdowns will be? And which departments will see the biggest impact?

This project dives into data from 45 retail stores, exploring how factors like the time of year, local economy, and strategic discounts influence sales. The goal? To turn this data into actionable insights.

## The Challenge

Retail is unpredictable. Every year brings new trends, different economic conditions, and the big question: what worked last year, and will it work again? The challenge is to make smart decisions based on limited history, especially during crucial weeks like Thanksgiving or Christmas.

Markdowns are key. Some drive massive sales; others don’t. Our task is to predict which markdowns will make the biggest difference and where.

## The Data

We’re working with three main datasets:

- **Stores**: Info about each of the 45 stores, like type and size.
- **Features**: Data on things like weekly temperatures, fuel prices, and markdowns. These outside factors can sway sales.
- **Sales**: Weekly sales numbers by department, showing how each store has performed over time.

## The Mission

Our mission: predict next year’s department-wide sales and figure out how markdowns affect sales during critical holiday weeks. It’s about spotting patterns, making sense of the data, and offering insights to shape future strategies.

## The Story

This project is about using the past to predict the future. It’s about understanding how markdowns, sales, and customer behavior intersect. Ultimately, it’s about helping retailers make better decisions.
